## Vagrant Documentation

To understand Vagrant, the starting point is to learn about teh role of Virtual Machines (VM) and how it works with Vagrant.

## Virtual Machine

As the name implies, it is a Virtual Machine, unlike a physical Windows or Mac laptop. My Windows laptop already has it's own operating system (OS) but I want to use another (OS) e.g Linux. To do this, I would need a VM. 

My Windows laptop will house a VM as the host machine while a VM will run as a guest machine using the hypervisor already built into my Windows laptop
